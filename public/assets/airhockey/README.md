# Air Hockey Game Assets

This directory contains the assets needed for the Air Hockey game. You'll need to add the following files:

## Required Image Assets:
- `airhockey-mod.png` - Background image for the air hockey table (1080x1280 recommended)
- `wizball.png` - Puck/ball sprite (circular, ~40x40px recommended)
- `blue.png` - Blue paddle sprite (circular, ~70x70px recommended)
- `red.png` - Red paddle sprite (circular, ~70x70px recommended)
- `help.png` - Help icon sprite
- `net-boss1.png` - Goal net sprite

## Required Audio Assets:
- `wall_sound.mp3` - Sound effect for puck hitting walls
- `puckhit.mp3` - Sound effect for paddle hitting puck
- `goal.mp3` - Sound effect for scoring a goal
- `music.mp3` - Background music (looping)
- `win.mp3` - Victory/cheer sound effect

## Asset Creation Tips:
- Use simple geometric shapes for paddles (circles work well)
- The puck can be a small circle or hockey puck shape
- Background should show an air hockey table with goal areas
- Audio files should be short and punchy for good game feel
- All images should have transparent backgrounds where appropriate

## Temporary Placeholders:
For now, you can use simple colored rectangles or circles as placeholders until you have proper assets.
